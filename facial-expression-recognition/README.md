##   Short Description 
# ðŸ˜Š Facial Expression Recognition

This project is a deep learning-based **Facial Expression Recognition** system that classifies human emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, and Neutral** from facial images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset and supports **real-time emotion detection via webcam** using OpenCV.
